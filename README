This directory contains open source clean room designed headers for
Luna as required to recompile the open source libraries and tools that
Palm ships with the Palm Pre and other WebOS devices.

All information added to these headers files must be directly
generated from information contained in other open source files, or
through reverse engineering of publicly available information.

Each individual piece of information must be annotated with the source
of the information, to ensure that the heritage of the information in
the file does not contain any Palm proprietary information or infringe
on any Palm copyright.  Please place these annotations inline in the
code comments.  Any code added without such annotations will be
removed immediately.
